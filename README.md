# ✅ **Project Title:**

**SQL Roadmap Learning Checklist Web App**

---

## 🧠 **Overview**

We’ve built a **professional, interactive, and animated Streamlit web application** that serves as a guided **SQL learning roadmap**. It is designed to help learners of all levels—from beginners to advanced SQL users—track their progress while studying structured topics. It combines **education**, **interactivity**, and **progress monitoring** into one modern, responsive tool.

This app can be used personally, in classrooms, or shared with the public to encourage consistent and structured learning of SQL.
